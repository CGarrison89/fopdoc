Conventions
===========

This page sets out the conventions used within this documentation. They are roughly similar to those used on [UESP.net](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:File_Format_Conventions).

## Data Types

These denote the type of data held in a field.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type<th>Byte Size<th>Description
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><td><td>
</table>

## Field Counts

These symbols are used to denote whether a record field is required or not, and how many times it may appear.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Symbol<th>Meaning
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>?<td>Unknown
    <tr><td>+<td>Appears once or more times.
    <tr><td>*<td>Appears zero or more times.
